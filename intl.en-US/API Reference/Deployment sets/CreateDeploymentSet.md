Optional values:-   \(Default\) CancelMembershipAndStart: Allows you to move the instance out of the deployment set and start the instance immediately after the instance has been shut down and migrated. However, the instance specification may change.
-   KeepStopped: The instance is not allowed to be moved out of the deployment set. The instance stays in an abnormal status until the new resources become available in the region. When the required resources become available, the instance can be started.
