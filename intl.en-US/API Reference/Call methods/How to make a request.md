# How to make a request {#IntroductionOfImporting .concept}

This section is applicable for users who make a GET request over HTTP or HTTPS protocol by sending a URL. If you prefer using [SDK](https://github.com/aliyun), Alibaba Cloud [CLI](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/29993.htm), or [API Explorer](https://api.aliyun.com/), skip this section.

The GET request URL, which can be directly used in a browser, has a formulated [request structure](intl.en-US/API Reference/Call methods/Request structure.md#).Â  The URL consists of several parameters, such as the [common request parameters](intl.en-US/API Reference/Call methods/Common parameters.md#), your [signature](intl.en-US/API Reference/Call methods/Signature.md#), and some API-specific parameters. We provide URL request example for every API. However, these URL examples are not encoded to make them easy to read. Thus, you must encode the URL before making a request. After the authentication process is complete, we [return the results](intl.en-US/API Reference/Call methods/Response results.md#) to you. The response parameters are displayed if it is a success response, and the error message is displayed if it is an error response. You can fix the error according to the common error codes and API-specific error codes.

**Note:** We recommend that you use SDK to manage your ECS resources or develop applications. It is easier for you to get started by using the language-specific SDK instead of making a request over HTTP or HTTPS. For more information, see Developer Resources.
