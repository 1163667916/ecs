# Change the operating system

You can change operating systems of instances, such as from Linux to Windows or from Ubuntu to CentOS. In regions outside mainland China, you can only change the operating system of an ECS instance between Linux editions or between Windows editions. You cannot change the operating system between Linux and Windows.

You can change the operating system of an instance by changing its system disk.

-   Change the image of the system disk to a non-public image. For more information, see [Replace the system disk \(non-public images\)](/intl.en-US/Block Storage/Cloud disks/Change the operating system/Replace the system disk (non-public images).md).
-   Change the image of the system disk to a public image. For more information, see [Replace the system disk \(public images\)](/intl.en-US/Block Storage/Cloud disks/Change the operating system/Replace the system disk (public images).md).
