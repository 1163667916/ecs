# End of support for operating systems

Due to reasons such as product lifecycle, third-party support, and evolution of open-source projects, Alibaba Cloud may stop providing technical support for some services after a period of time since the release of the services. Understanding the technical support plans of services or software can help you update the services or software to general availability \(GA\) versions in a timely manner. When you use ECS, you need to pay attention to the lifecycle plans of image operating systems. These plans are published in the official website of the operating systems.

**Note:** When an operating system version comes to the end-of-life \(EOL\), Alibaba Cloud will stop providing support for the ECS instances that use the operating system version.
