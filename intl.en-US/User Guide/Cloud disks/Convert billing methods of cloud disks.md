# Convert billing methods of cloud disks {#concept_zpt_5g3_ydb .concept}

The billing method of a cloud disk depends on how it is created:

-   For cloud disks created with Subscription \(monthly or yearly subscription\) instances, upfront payment is required for the service to be ready for use. For more information, see [Subscription](../../../../intl.en-US/Pricing/Subscription.md#).
-   For cloud disks created jointly with Pay-As-You-Go instances or separately created are billed on a Pay-As-You-Go basis. For more information, see [Pay-As-You-Go](../../../../intl.en-US/Pricing/Pay-As-You-Go.md#).

You can change the billing method of a cloud disk, as shown in the following table.
