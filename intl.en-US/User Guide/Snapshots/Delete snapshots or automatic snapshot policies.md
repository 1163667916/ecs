# Delete snapshots or automatic snapshot policies {#concept_ch5_2pl_xdb .concept}

When you no longer need a snapshot, or you have reached your snapshot quota, you can delete snapshots to free up space.

**Note:** 

-   After a snapshot is deleted, it cannot be restored. So proceed with caution.
-   If a snapshot has been used to create a custom image, you must delete the associated image before you can delete the snapshot.
