# Create and delete an automatic snapshot policy {#concept_smh_y2l_xdb .concept}

An automatic snapshot policy is a set of defined parameters for automatically creating snapshots.

**Note:** 

-   Avoid business peak hours when you set the automatic snapshot creation time and repeated date, because creating a snapshot may slightly impact the performance of the disk.
-   You can create a maximum of 100 automatic snapshot policies in a region.

## Prerequisite {#section_odg_ffl_xdb .section}

If you want to modify an automatic snapshot policy, you must first create an automatic snapshot policy.

## Procedure {#section_pdg_ffl_xdb .section}

To create an automatic snapshot policy, follow these steps:

1.  Log on to the [ECS console](https://ecs.console.aliyun.com/#/home).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, select **Snapshots and Images** \> **Automatic Snapshot Policy**.
3.  On the Create Automatic Snapshot Policy page,
    -   if you want to create a policy, click **Create Policy** at the upper-right corner.
    -   if you want to modify a policy, find the policy that you want to modify, and click **Modify Policy** in the **Actions** column.
4.  In the Create Policy or Modify Policy dialog box, define an automatic snapshot policy:
    -   Define a policy name.
    -   Select a time after **Executed At** to specify the time of day for automatically creating snapshots. There are 24 time points available between 00:00 and 23:00.
    -   **Execution Frequency**: There are seven repetition days available.
    -   Set a period after **Keep Snapshots** to defines the number of days a snapshot can be retained. This parameter can be set between 1âˆ’65535 days, or permanently. By default, it is set to 30 days. You can also choose to keep automatic snapshots always.

        **Note:** When the number of snapshots reaches the limit, the system automatically removes the oldest automatic snapshots created. Manually created snapshots are not affected.

5.  Click **OK**.
