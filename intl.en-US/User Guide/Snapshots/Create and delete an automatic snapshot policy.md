# Create and delete an automatic snapshot policy {#concept_smh_y2l_xdb .concept}

An automatic snapshot policy is a set of defined parameters for automatically creating snapshots.

**Note:** 

-   Avoid business peak hours when you set the automatic snapshot creation time and repeat date, because creating a snapshot may slightly impact the performance of the disk.
-   You can create a maximum of 100 automatic snapshot policies in each region.

## Prerequisite {#section_odg_ffl_xdb .section}

If you want to modify an automatic snapshot policy, you must first create an automatic snapshot policy.

## Procedure {#section_pdg_ffl_xdb .section}

To create an automatic snapshot policy, perform the following:

1.  Log on to the [ECS console](https://ecs.console.aliyun.com/#/home).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, select **Snapshots & Images** \> **Automatic Snapshot Policy**.
3.  On the Create Automatic Snapshot Polic page.
    -   If you want to create a policy: Click **Create Policy** in the upper-right corner.
    -   If you want to modify a policy: find the policy that you want to modify, in the **Actions**column, click **Modify Policy**.
4.  In the Create Policy , or Modify Policy dialog box, define an automatic snapshot policy:
    -   Define automatic snapshot policy parameters:
    -   Select **Time** Defines the time of day for automatically creating snapshots. There are 24 snapshot creation points available between 00:00 and 23:00.
    -   **Repeated day**: There are seven available repetition day configurations.
    -   Select the automatic snapshot **Retention period**: Defines the number of days a snapshot can be retained. This parameter can be set between 1âˆ’65536 days, or permanently. By default, it is set to 30 days. You can also choose to keep automatic snapshots.

        **Note:** When the number of snapshots reaches the limit, the system automatically removes the oldest automatic snapshots that were created. Manually created snapshots are not affected.

5.  Click **OK**.
