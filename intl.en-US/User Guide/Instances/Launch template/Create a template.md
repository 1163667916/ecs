# Create a template {#concept_pzl_ww5_xdb .concept}

You can create a template using the following methods:

-   If you do not want to create instances at this time, you can still [Create a template in the ECS console](#console) create templates using the ECS console, and then create instances using your required template in one click when needed.

-   If you want to create an instance and save its configuration information, [Create a template on the ECS buy page](#commonbuy) go to the ECS buy page to create templates.


**Note:** 

-   In each region, one user account can only create a maximum of 30 launch templates.
-   All parameters are optional when you create a template using the ECS console.Â  However, if the template that you want to use to create an instance does not have all required parameters \(such as an image\), then you must specify the required parameters at instance creation.
-   A template cannot be modified once you have created it.
