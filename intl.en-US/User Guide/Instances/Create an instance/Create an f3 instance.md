# Create an f3 instance {#concept_myr_2m1_ydb .concept}

This article describes how to create an f3 instance.

**Note:** We recommend that you use instances with at least four cores for testing, such as instance type family g5-ecs.g5.2xlarge \(8 vCPU core, 32 GiB\).

## Prerequisite {#section_bsy_fm1_ydb .section}

Please submit a ticket to request a free f3 instance for testing. This instance type is currently in public beta release.

## Procedure {#section_csy_fm1_ydb .section}

For more information about how to create an f3 instance, seeÂ [create an ECS instance](../../../../reseller.en-US/Quick Start for Entry-Level Users/Step 2. Create an instance.md#). However, the following configurations are recommended:

-   **Billing Method**: Select **Pay-As-You-Go** or **Subscription**.

    **Note:** 

    -   During the testing phase, f3 instances are available for free. Other ECS resources including cloud disks, public network bandwidth, and snapshots will incur usage fees.
    -   f3 instances are not available as preemptible instances.
-   **Region**: Select **China East 2 \(Shanghai\)**.
-   **Instance Type**: Select **Heterogeneous Computing** \> **FPGA Compute**, and then select your required instance type.
-   **Image**: Click **Shared Image**, and then select the specified image.

    **Note:** A Xilinx image is available for use \(recommended\). The image is only available as a Shared image. To obtain the image, please submit a ticket.

-   **System Disk**: Allocate a 200 GiB Ultra Cloud Disk for the system image.
-   **Network**: Select **VPC**.
