# Create an f2 instance {#concept_cdy_gk1_ydb .concept}

This article describes how to create an f2 instance.

## Prerequisites {#section_ywv_jk1_ydb .section}

You need an image pre-installed with the development environment of Xilinx to create an f2 instance. We can share the image with you. This is the only method to get the image. To apply for the image, [open a ticket](https://workorder-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ticket/createIndex) .

## Procedure {#section_s2l_jk1_ydb .section}

Follow the steps described in [create an ECS instance](../../../../intl.en-US/Quick Start for Entry-Level Users/Step 2. Create an instance.md#), but before doing so, consider the following:

-   **Region**: Select **China East 1 \(Hangzhou\)** \> **China East 1 Zone B**.
-   **Instance Type**: Select **Heterogeneous Computing** \> **FPGA** \> **Compute**.
-   **Image**: Click **Shared Image**, and then select the shared image.
-   **Network**: Select **VPC**, and select a created VPC and VSwitch.
