You can delete templates and versions using the ECS console. Once you delete a template, all the versions of that template are also deleted.

## Delete a version {#section_nqw_4cv_xdb .section}

1.  Log on to the [ECS console](https://ecs.console.aliyun.com/?spm=a2c4g.11186623.2.9.FNEORG#/home).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Launch Template**.
3.  Select a template ID and check its version details.
4.  In the **Version Information** area, locate the version you want to delete, and inÂ  **Actions** column, click **Delete**.

    **Note:** You cannot delete the default template version. You only can delete non-default versions. If the version you want to delete is the default version, change it to a non-default version, and then delete it. If all versions in a single template are not needed, we recommend that you delete the template.
