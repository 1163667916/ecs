# Connect to a Linux instance by using an SSH key pair {#concept_ucj_wrx_wdb .concept}

How to use a key pair to log on to a Linux instance depends on the local operating system.

-   [Windows OS](#windows)
-   [Linux OS or other systems supporting SSH commands](#linux)

**Note:** You can use a password to connect to a Linux instance. For more information, see  [Connect to a Linux instance by using a password](intl.en-US/User Guide/Connect to instances/Connect to a Linux instance by using a password.md#) and [Connect to an instance by using the Management Terminal](intl.en-US/User Guide/Connect to instances/Connect to an instance by using the Management Terminal.md#).

## Windows OS {#windows .section}

In this section, it is demonstrated how to use a key pair to log on to a Linux instance on a Windows system, using the popular SSH tools PuTTY and PuTTYgen as an example.

**Prerequisites**

-   PuTTY and PuTTYgen must have been installed. You can download them at:

    -   [PuTTY](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty.exe)
    -   [PuTTYgen](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/puttygen.exe)
-   You must have a Linux instance that has been bound to an instance. You can allocate an SSH key pair when creating an instance or  [bind an SSH key pair to an instance](intl.en-US/User Guide/Key pairs/Bind or unbind an SSH key pair.md#).

-   Add the following rule in the security group to enable the access to the TCP Port 22 of the instance. For more information, see [Add security group rules](intl.en-US/User Guide/Security groups/Add security group rules.md#).

    |Network Type|NIC|Rule Direction|Authorization Policy|Protocol Type|Port Range|Authorization Type|Authorization Object|Priority|
    |------------|---|--------------|--------------------|-------------|----------|------------------|--------------------|--------|
    |VPC|N/A|Inbound|Allow|SSH\(22\)|22/22|Address Field Access|0.0.0.0/0|1|
    |Classic|Internet|


**Procedure**

1.  Optional. If you are using a key pair generated by Alibaba Cloud, of which the private key is a .pem file, you must convert it to a .ppk file. If your private key is a .ppk file, you can skip this step.

    **Note:** When you [create an SSH key pair](intl.en-US/User Guide/Key pairs/Create an SSH key pair.md#), download the .pem private key.

    1.  Start PuTTYgen. In this example, we use PuTTYgen version 0.68.
    2.  Under **the** \> **Type of key to generate option,** select RSA.

        **Note:** **The value of Number of bits in a generated key** can be left as is. The software automatically update the value based on the imported private key information.

    3.  Click **Load** to find your .pem file.

        **Note:** By default, PuTTYgen only displays files with an extension of .ppk.

    4.  Select the downloaded private key file from Alibaba Cloud, or the ready private key file, and click **Open**.
    5.  Click **OK** to close the confirmation dialog box.
    6.  Click **Save private key**. PuTTYgen displays warning about saving the key without a password. Click **Yes**.
    7.  Specify the same name for the private key with the key pair, and save the settings. PuTTY automatically adds the .ppk file.
2.  Start PuTTY.
3.  Select **Connection \>** \> **SSH \>** \> **Auth.**Click **Browse…** and select the .ppk file generated in Step 1.

4.  Click **Session**.
    -   In Host Name \(or IP address\), enter your account and the public IP address of the instance to be connected to. The format is root@IP address.
    -   In Port enter the port number 22.
    -   For Connection type, select SSH.

5.  Click **Open** to start accessing your Linux instance.

When the window shows  `Connection established.`, it indicates you have successfully logged on to the instance using the key pair.

## Linux OS or other systems supporting SSH commands {#linux .section}

In this section, it is demonstrated how to use a key pair to log on to a Linux instance on a Linux system or a system supporting SSH commands, such as MobaXterm for Windows.

**Prerequisites**

You must have a Linux instance that has been bound to an SSH key pair. You can [allocate an SSH key pair when creating an instance ](../../../../intl.en-US/Quick Start for Entry-Level Users/Step 2. Create an instance.md#), or [bind an SSH key pair to an instance](intl.en-US/User Guide/Key pairs/Bind or unbind an SSH key pair.md#).

Add the following rule in the security group to enable the access to the TCP Port 22 of the instance. For more information, see [Add security group rules](intl.en-US/User Guide/Security groups/Add security group rules.md#).

|Network Type|NIC|Rule Direction|Authorization Policy|Protocol Type|Port Range|Authorization Type|Authorization Object|Priority|
|------------|---|--------------|--------------------|-------------|----------|------------------|--------------------|--------|
|VPC|N/A|Inbound|Allow|SSH\(22\)|22/22|Address Field Access|0.0.0.0/0|1|
|Classic|Internet|

**Procedure**

1.  Locate directory of your private key, for example, /root/xxx.pem.

    **Note:** When you [create an SSH key pair](intl.en-US/User Guide/Key pairs/Create an SSH key pair.md#), download the .pem private key. xxx.pem is the private key file.

2.  To modify the attributes of the private key, run the command: `chmod 400 [directory of the private key file]`. For example, `chmod 400 /root/xxx.pem`.
3.  To connect to the instance, run the command `ssh -i directory of the private key file] root@Internet IP address`. For example, `ssh -i /root/xxx.pem root@10.10.10.100`.
