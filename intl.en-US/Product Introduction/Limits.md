# Limits {#concept_gvb_h1w_tdb .concept}

This topic describes service limits of ECS and how to request exceptions to the limits.

## Overview {#section_nxc_2zs_2gb .section}

ECS has the following service limits:

-   ECS does not allow you to install virtualization software, such as VMware Workstation, or use it for re-virtualization. Only [ECS Bare Metal Instances](reseller.en-US/Instances/Instance type families/ECS bare metal instance type family/What is an ECS Bare Metal Instance?.md#) and [Super Computing Clusters](../../../../reseller.en-US/Instances/Instance type families/Super Computing Cluster instance type family/What is a Super Computing Cluster?.md#) support re-virtualization.
-   ECS does not support sound card applications.
-   External hardware devices, such as hardware dongles, USB flash drives, external hard disks, and hardware tokens, cannot be attached. Software verification methods such as two-factor authentication and dynamic passwords can be used.
-   ECS does not support IP address translation services such as SNAT. Instead, it achieves this function by using VPNs and proxies.
-   ECS does not support multicast protocols. We recommend that you use unicast instead.
-   Log Service does not support 32-bit Linux ECS instances. For information about regions that support Log Service, see [Service endpoint](../../../../reseller.en-US/API Reference/Service endpoint.md#). For information about operating systems that support Log Service, see the [Overview](../../../../reseller.en-US/Data Collection/Logtail collection/Overview/Overview.md#) section about Logtail collection.

## View quotas {#section_thb_aai_kpr .section}

On the Overview page of the ECS console, click **Privileges & Quotas** and select a region to view the resource quotas in that region. If the quota of a resource cannot meet your needs, submit a ticket to request an increase for the quota. For more information, see [Manage privileges and quotas](../../../../reseller.en-US/Tags & Resource Management /Manage privileges and quotas.md#). You can also view resource quotas by calling an API operation. For more information, see [DescribeAccountAttributes](../../../../reseller.en-US/API Reference/Others/DescribeAccountAttributes.md#).

## Security group limits {#section_mzr_52x_wdb .section}

|Item|Limit on basic security groups|Limit on advanced security groups|
|----|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
|Total number of security groups in each region for an account|100.|Same as that on basic security groups.|
|Number of classic network-type ECS instances that can be added to a classic network-type security group|1,000.[\*](#)|Classic network is not supported.|
|Number of VPC-type ECS instances that can be added to a VPC-type security group|Depends on the [number of private IP addresses in a VPC-type security group](#).|No limit.|
|Number of security groups that can contain the same ECS instance|5. You can submit a ticket to raise the limit to 10 or 16 security groups.

 |Same as that on basic security groups.|
|Number of security groups that can contain the same ENI of an ECS instance|
|Maximum number of rules \(both inbound and outbound\) in a security group|100.[\*\*\*](#)|Same as that on basic security groups.|
|Maximum number of rules \(both inbound and outbound\) in all security groups that contain the same ENI|500.|Same as that on basic security groups.|
|Number of private IP addresses in a VPC-type security group|2,000.[\*\*](#)|No limit.|
|Number of ENIs in a VPC-type security group|Depends on the [maximum number of rules in a security group](#).|50,000.|
|Public network access port|The default STMP port for outbound traffic is port 25, which is disabled by default. It cannot be enabled by security group rules.|Same as that on basic security groups.|

\* If more than 1,000 classic network-type instances need access to each other, you can distribute them across multiple security groups and authorize mutual access.

\*\* If you require mutual access among more than 2,000 private IP addresses, you can distribute them across multiple security groups and authorize mutual access.

\*\*\* If you increase the number of security groups that can contain the same ECS instance, the maximum number of rules in a security group will decrease. The product of the number of security groups that can contain the same ECS instance and the maximum number of rules \(both inbound and outbound\) in a security group must be less than or equal to 500. For example, 5 Ã— 100 = 500, 10 Ã— 50 = 500, and 16 Ã— 30 < 500.
