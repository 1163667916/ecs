# ECS instance creation overview {#concept_nx2_nzv_wgb .concept}

This topic describes several methods by which to create an ECS instance, from basic creation operations to advanced customization operations.

Generally, we recommend that you create an ECS instance by following the instructions prompted by the wizard, which allows you to choose configurations flexibly. For more information, see [使用向导创建实例](reseller.en-US/Instances/Create an instance/Create an instance by using the wizard.md#).

**Note:** If you require custom configurations \(such as a specific operating system or application\), you can create a custom image and then select that image during the creation of an instance to improve configuration efficiency. For more information, see [使用自定义镜像创建实例](reseller.en-US/Instances/Create an instance/Create an instance by using a custom image.md#).

If you need a new instance to have the same configuration as the current instance, you can create an instance of the same configuration directly. For more information, see [创建相同配置的实例](reseller.en-US/Instances/Create an instance/Create an instance of the same configuration.md#).

You can also create a launch template in advance, and then use it to create a new instance in one click as needed. For more information, see [通过启动模板创建实例](reseller.en-US/Instances/Create an instance/Use a launch template.md#) and [什么是实例启动模板](reseller.en-US/Instances/Manage instances/Launch template/Launch templates.md#).
