# SCU billing methods

You can use Storage Capacity Units \(SCUs\) to offset bills of different storage resources, such as disks, Object Storage Service \(OSS\), Apsara File Storage NAS, and snapshots. SCUs use the subscription billing method. The all-upfront payment option is supported.

## Billing methods

SCUs use the subscription billing method and are measured by their capacity. You can subscribe to an SCU for 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 3 years, or 5 years.

## Expiration

After an SCU expires, you cannot use it to offset the bills of pay-as-you-go storage resources. If you have no other SCUs in the same region, those pay-as-you-go resources will be billed on a pay-as-you-go basis.
