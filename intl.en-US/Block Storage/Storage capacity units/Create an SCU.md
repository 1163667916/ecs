# Create an SCU

This topic describes how to create a storage capacity unit \(SCU\) in the ECS console.

You do not have overdue payments in your account.

1.  Log on to the [ECS console](https://ecs.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Storage & Snapshots** \> **Storage Capacity Units**.

3.  Click **Create Storage Capacity Unit**.

4.  Configure the following parameters on the SCU buy page.

    |Parameter|Description|Example|
    |---------|-----------|-------|
    |Region|The region of the SCU.|**China \(Hangzhou\)**|
    |SCU Specification|The capacity of the SCU.|**1 TB**|
    |Deductible Product Type|The deductible products and the corresponding deduction factors.|None|
    |SCU Name|The name of the SCU.|Example for SCU deduction|
    |Quantity|The quantity of SCUs that you want to purchase.|1|
    |Validity Period|The validity period of the SCU.|**1 Month**|
    |Effective Time|The effective time of the SCU. Valid values:     -   **Now**: The SCU takes effect immediately after purchase.
    -   **Specify Effective Time**: The SCU takes effect at the specified time after purchase.

After you purchase an SCU, you can find it in the **Creating** state on the **Storage Capacity Units** page. When the status of the SCU changes to **Running**, the SCU begins to offset bills of eligible pay-as-you-go resources in the current region.
