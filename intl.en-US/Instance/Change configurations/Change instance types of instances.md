# Change instance types of instances

This topic describes the instance types and families that support instance type changes. If your current instance type does not meet your business needs, check whether the instance type can be changed. If yes, choose a method to change the instance type.

## Impact of instance type changes

The impact of an instance type change varies depending on the network type of the instance.

-   Classic network-type instances:
    -   For retired instance types, when a non-I/O optimized instance is upgraded to an I/O optimized instance, instance information including the private IP address, disk device names, and software authorization codes will be changed. For Linux instances, the device names of basic disks \(`cloud`\) will be identified as `xvda` or `xvdb`, and the device names of ultra disks \(`cloud_efficiency`\) and standard SSDs \(`cloud_ssd`\) will be identified as `vda` or `vdb`.
    -   If the instance belongs to an available instance family, the private IP address of the instance will be changed.
-   VPC-type instances:

## Instance families that do not support instance type changes

The following instance families do not support instance type changes between different families or within the same family:

-   Big data instance families: d2c, d2s, d1, and d1ne
-   Instance families with local SSDs: i1, i2, i2g, i2ne, and i2gne
-   GPU-accelerated compute optimized instance families: vgn5i, gn5, and gn6i
-   FPGA-accelerated compute optimized instance families: f1 and f3
-   ECS Bare Metal Instance families: ebmgn6e, ebmgn6v, ebmgn6i, ebmc6, ebmg6, ebmr6, ebmhfc6, ebmhfg6, ebmhfr6, ebmc5s, ebmg5s, ebmr5s, ebmhfg5, ebmc4, and ebmg5
-   Super Computing Cluster \(SCC\) instance families: scchfc6, scchfg6, scchfr6, sccg5, scch5, and sccgn6

## Instance families that support instance type changes

The following tables list instance families that support instance type changes. The compatible instance families apply to both subscription and pay-as-you-go instances. For more information about how to change instance types, see [Overview of instance upgrade and downgrade](/intl.en-US/Instance/Change configurations/Overview of instance upgrade and downgrade.md).

**Note:** Some instance types may not be available in all zones. Before you change the instance type of an instance, check whether the compatible instance type or instance family is available in the current zone.

-   g6e, c6e, and r6e
-   re6, hfc6, hfg6, and hfr6
-   t6 and s6

**Note:**

-   To upgrade an instance that belongs to the g6, c6, or r6 instance family to an instance type that belongs to an enhanced sixth-generation instance family such as g6e, c6e, or r6e, or to a seventh-generation instance family such as hfc7, hfg7, or hfr7, [submit a ticket](https://workorder-intl.console.aliyun.com/console.htm). After the upgrade is complete, you will not be able to downgrade the instance type of the instance.
-   Instances of the enhanced sixth-generation instance families such as g6e, c6e, and r6e, and instances of the seventh-generation instance families such as hfc7, hfg7, and hfr7 support only enhanced SSDs \(ESSDs\). If your instance is attached with disks of other categories, the disks will be replaced with ESSDs and the data on the disks must be manually migrated to the ESSDs when you upgrade the instance to an instance type that belongs to an enhanced sixth-generation instance family or an seventh-generation instance family. For information about the pricing of ESSDs, see [ECS pricing](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/ecs). |
