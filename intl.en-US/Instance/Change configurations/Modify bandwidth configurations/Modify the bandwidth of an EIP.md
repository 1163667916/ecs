# Modify the bandwidth of an EIP

VPC-type ECS instances are associated with elastic IP addresses \(EIPs\) to access the Internet. This topic describes how to use the Bandwidth Adjustment feature to modify the peak bandwidth of an EIP. This feature applies to both subscription and pay-as-you-go instances.

The ECS instance is associated with an EIP.

1.  Log on to the [ECS console](https://ecs.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Instances & Images** \> **Instances**.

3.  In the top navigation bar, select a region.

4.  Find the instance for which you want to modify the bandwidth and click **Upgrade/Downgrade** in the **Actions** column.

5.  In the Upgrade/Downgrade Wizard dialog box, select **Bandwidth Adjustment** and click **Continue**.

6.  Select a new peak bandwidth.

    For more information, see [Upgrade or downgrade the bandwidth of a pay-as-you-go EIP](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Manage Pay-As-You-Go-billed EIPs/Upgrade or downgrade the bandwidth of a pay-as-you-go EIP.md).

7.  Read and select *Elastic IP Agreement of Service* and click **Activate**.

    **Note:** You do not need to restart the instance after you modify the bandwidth. The new configurations take effect immediately.
